## Usage 🚀

The application revolves around three main classes:

### Histogram Class 📈

The `Histogram` class is a generic container that maintains a map of elements (`key`) along with their frequency of occurrence. It provides methods to retrieve the frequency of a specific element, obtain the set of unique elements, and increase the frequency of an element.

### HistogramDisplay Class 🖥️

The `HistogramDisplay` class extends JFreeChart's `ApplicationFrame` and is responsible for graphically displaying the histogram.

### Kata3 Class 🚀
The `Kata3` class contains the `main` method, serving as the entry point for program execution. It creates a `Histogram` object, increments some frequencies, and displays the histogram using `HistogramDisplay`.
